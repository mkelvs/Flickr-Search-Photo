# Flickr Search Photo

Usage: 

This is a small project I learned in using the Flickr API.
You can search a specific photo by typing through the search input.
The program will access Flickr's public API photo and it will search the tag name that contains the search input.
Photos containing the tag name will be displayed.

Libraries used:

jQuery

*** This has been a cool project where I get to learn and use jQuery AJAX shorthand methods. I had difficulties playing and understanding them at the beginning as there are multiple callback functions that were used. I had bugs showing and tried to console.log() each event to undestand where I am getting the error. ***
